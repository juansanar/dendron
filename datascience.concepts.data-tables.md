# Tabular Data

Data tables are [[structured data |datascience.concepts.data-formats#Structured-data]] arranged in rows (aka `records`) and columns  (aka `field`). Values are in the intersection of rows and columns (i.e., entity in a given `cell` within a spreadsheet).

# Structures of Tabular Data

## Wide Data

Every data subject has a single row with multiple columns to hold the values of various attributes of the subject.

## Long Data

Each row is one time point (observation) per subject, so each suibject will have data in multiple rows.

Makes tabular data compact and easier to transform data.
