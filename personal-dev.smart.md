# What is SMART criteria?

Originally published by George T. Doran (1981 isseu of *Management Review*[^1]), SMART means:

- Specific – target a specific area for improvement.
- Measurable – quantify or at least suggest an indicator of progress.
- Achieveable – Attainable and not impossible to achieve.
- Realistic – state what results can realistically be achieved, given available resources.
- Time-related – specify when the result(s) can be achieved.

It gives a guide to setting of goals and objectives for better results, for example in project management, employee-performance management and personal development

> Notice that these criteria don't say that all objectives must be quantified on all levels of management. In certain situations, it is not realistic to attempt quantification, particularly in staff middle-management positions. Practicing managers and corporations can lose the benefit of a more abstract objective in order to gain quantification. It is the combination of the objective and its action plan that is really important. Therefore serious management should focus on these twins and not just the objective.
