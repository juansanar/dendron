# Understanding data and fairness

Data analysis must be fair. Solutions from data analysis should lead to creating systems that are fair and inclusive for everyone.

> Fairness i data analytics means ensuring that data analysis does not create or reinforce bias. This requires using processes and systems that are fair and inclusive.

Someimtes the outcome of an analysis is can be **true** and **unfair**.
- To mitiagte this ensure you are taking into account bias and the whole picture (including the complicated social context)

## Data ethics

- When it comes to data ethics, it is not just about minimizing harm but the concept of beneficence.
- We should ensure that there are actionable ways where people can consent to give that data and ways that they can ask for it to be revoked or removed.
