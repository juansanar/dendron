# Changelogs take you down the last mile

A changelog can build on your automated version history by giving you an even more detailed record of your work. This is where data analysts record all the changes they make to the data. Here is another way of looking at it. Version histories record what was done in a data change for a project, but don't tell us why. Changelogs are super useful for helping us understand the reasons changes have been made. Changelogs have no set format and you can even make your entries in a blank document. But if you are using a shared changelog, it is best to agree with other data analysts on the format of all your log entries.

- Typically, a changelog records this type of information:  
- Data, file, formula, query, or any other component that changed
- Description of what changed
- Date of the change
- Person who made the change
- Person who approved the change  
- Version number  
- Reason for the change

> Letâ€™s say you made a change to a formula in a spreadsheet because you observed it in another report and you wanted your data to match and be consistent. If you found out later that the report was actually using the wrong formula, an automated version history would help you undo the change. But if you also recorded the reason for the change in a changelog, you could go back to the creators of the report and let them know about the incorrect formula. If the change happened a while ago, you might not remember who to follow up with. Fortunately, your changelog would have that information ready for you! By following up, you would ensure data integrity outside your project. You would also be showing personal integrity as someone who can be trusted with data. That is the power of a changelog!
