## Academia vs. Industry

Since a very young age I knew I wanted to be a neuroscientist. I can pinpoint the exact moment the 6-year-old version of myself decided to elaborate a plan to become a physician and neuroscientist. It was a typical hot and partly sunny *Cale√±a* afternoon after school. I was sitting (relatively close) to the 21" screen of catode TV (my myopia is really really bad). I had tunned in Discovery Channel (a personal favourite at the time) watching yet another fascinating documentary. Discovry Channel used to hold an extremely motivating and science friendly broadcasting program. In this particular time, the primary subject of the documentary was brain-machine interfaces, with a special focus on why understanding the inner working of the brain was (and continues to be) one of the most important challenges for humankind and how this understanding can lead to revolutionary therapeutic approaches to cure blindness, improve prothesis, and aid in the recovery of those affected by traumatic injuries to the nervous system.
