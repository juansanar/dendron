# What is a wordcloud?

A wordcloud (aka word collage) is a visual representation of words based on the frequency they appear in a given text. While there are online tools to make them, they can be easily produce using `r` and the `tidytext` and `wordcloud` (or `wordcloud2`) packages.

## Handling text

Handling in text in `r` is made easier with the package `tidytext`. 

- Book reference: ["Text mining with R"](https://www.tidytextmining.com/index.html) (by Julia Silge and David Robinson)
- For a reference of how to use `tidytext` on a dataset with F.R.I.E.N.D.S. transcripts see David Robinson's #tidytuesday [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgcBEBqVnx8).
