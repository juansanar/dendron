# Verification - A checklist approach
- **Sources of errors**: Did you use the right tools and functions to find the source of the errors in your dataset?

- **Null data**: Did you search for `NULLs` using conditional formatting and filters?
- **Misspelled words**: Did you locate all misspellings?
- **Mistyped numbers**: Did you double-check that your numeric data has been entered correctly?
- **Extra spaces and character**s: Did you remove any extra spaces or characters using the `TRIM` function?
- **Duplicates**: Did you remove duplicates in spreadsheets using the Remove Duplicates function or `DISTINCT` in SQL?
- **Mismatched data types**: Did you check that numeric, date, and string data are typecast correctly?
- **Messy (inconsistent) strings**: Did you make sure that all of your strings are consistent and meaningful?
- **Messy (inconsistent) date formats**: Did you format the dates consistently throughout your dataset?
- **Misleading variable labels (columns)**: Did you name your columns meaningfully?
- **Truncated data**: Did you check for truncated or missing data that needs correction?
- **Business Logic**: Did you check that the data makes sense given your knowledge of the business? 

## Review the goal of your project

- Confirm the business problem 
- Confirm the goal of the project
- Verify that data can solve the problem and is aligned to the goal
