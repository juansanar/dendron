High Impact presentations have 4 elements:

# Inspiring purpose
> The only reason to give a speech is to change the world - John F. Kennedy

Purpose != Presentation topic. 

## Audience benefit

You can elevate your presentation topic to a higher purpose by **heightening** your Audience's Benefit! Audiences typically seek:

- Learn new information: What can you tell them that they didn't know?
- Shift paradigm: What spin can you put on what they already knew?
- Gain new skills: What can you teach them? What can they do now after your presentation that they couldn't do before?
- Solve problems: What are you showing that will help them to overcome their challenges?
- Generate ideas: How can you spark fresh thinking?
- Elevate status: What can you give them that they can share with others? What can you give them to help them elevate them socially/professionally?

## Societal Impact

Balance your audience's benefit with the societal impact of th topic of your presentation. Identify and highlight your presentation's broader benefits to the community.

- Increase problem awareness: What significant problems might your audience not knoww?
- Broaden perspectives: What narrow perspectives can your presentation help to expand?
- Generate empathy for a cause: For what important issue might your audience hasve too litte compasion?
- Address social injustices: What social inequalities might your audience know little?

> The greater your purpose, the greater your passion.
