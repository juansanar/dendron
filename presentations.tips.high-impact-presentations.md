High Impact presentations have 4 elements:

# Inspiring purpose
> The only reason to give a speech is to change the world - John F. Kennedy

Purpose != Presentation topic.

- Struggling with finding passion in a topic? Try [*Chunking up*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chunking_(psychology)). Try envision the bigger picture, the borader goal of your specific topic.

## Audience benefit

You can elevate your presentation topic to a higher purpose by **heightening** your Audience's Benefit! Audiences typically seek:

- Learn new information: What can you tell them that they didn't know?
- Shift paradigm: What spin can you put on what they already knew?
- Gain new skills: What can you teach them? What can they do now after your presentation that they couldn't do before?
- Solve problems: What are you showing that will help them to overcome their challenges?
- Generate ideas: How can you spark fresh thinking?
- Elevate status: What can you give them that they can share with others? What can you give them to help them elevate them socially/professionally?

> Research your audience: From knowing who they are, to identifying potential partenrs (bonding), reasons to attend, their learning style, what do they know, how might they resist?

### Overcoming the curse of knowledge

- Mind the gap
- Build a bridge
- Use clear, concrete language
- Tell illustrative stories

## Societal Impact

Balance your audience's benefit with the societal impact of th topic of your presentation. Identify and highlight your presentation's broader benefits to the community.

- Increase problem awareness: What significant problems might your audience not knoww?
- Broaden perspectives: What narrow perspectives can your presentation help to expand?
- Generate empathy for a cause: For what important issue might your audience hasve too litte compasion?
- Address social injustices: What social inequalities might your audience know little?

> The greater your purpose, the greater your passion.

# Strong presence

Strong presence = Competence + Warmth

- Competence = Passion + Expertise
    - Passionte speakers have a unique perspective and **uncompromising** attitude.
    - Expertise: Being able to deliver content in a conversational style.
        - People reading from cards, speaking in an overly formal style, or read slides come across as not knowing hteir subject matter well.
- Warmth = Honesty, relatedness, vulnerability
    - Honesty: Acknowledge limitations
    - Relatedness: What stories can you hsare that others can identify with?
        - Beware of self-centered narratives. 
    - Vulnerability: No barriers to share concerns about the presentation content or delivery outcome

> Strong presence -> Compelling content

# Compelling content

- Strong opening: Hook them within 7 seconds, keep them engage to the peak (1 minute)
- Communicate one big idea: Focus on delivering one big idea that summarizes the topic and purpose.
- Include exactly THREE ideas
    - Apply this across levels of your presentation: For example, one key message can have THREE key arguments, and each of them have THREE supporting facts
- Illustrate your stories
    - Nancy Duarte's compelling pattern: "What is and what could be?" Show the present option, show your solution
    - Good illustrations enahance impact and memorability
    - Beware of self-centered narratives. Your audience should be the heroes. Focus on how your solutions/products empower your audience
- Incorporate profound moments
    - Memorable dramatizations: Can you illustrate the key point? Think of Steve Jobs showing the thinness of the Macbook Air by taking it out of Manila envelope
    - Repreatable soundbites: Find a way to repeat your key messages as soundbites (e.g., on the IPhone, "reinvent the phone")
- Evocative visuals: Reinforce your crucial points with big impactful visuals
- Emotive storytelling
- Shocking statistics: Power up the audience with great data visualizations and interesting facts
- Keep the Narrative concise: "Are you including a slide to help the audience or help yourself?" (Alisha Karia)
- Have a rewarding ending: Leave your audiencew with a vivid picture of the potential rewards of taking your recommendations.
    - Make your presentation multisensory if possible (beyond visuals and sounds even!)

# Clear design

> Robert E. Mayer: 12 Principles of Multimedia Learning

- Use bite-sized chunks
    - Use **segmentation** to break your presentation into digestable pieces.
        - This can include setting up controls to move aorund the presentations, hyperlinks, video controls, etc
        - 1 slide = 1 idea.
            - Slides with more than 1 idea need to be broken up in multiple slides
- Convey simple messages:
    - Achieve **coherence** by eliminating unnecesary information (get rid of the extra flulff that does not reinforce your ONE big idea and THREE key messages)
- Communicate Hierarchy
    - Also known as **signaling**, it uses visual cues to organize information and indicate its inmportance. The most critical points should be in a bigger font, for example.
- Use images effectively
    - **Modality** dictates that graphics should be combined with narration rather than animations with text
    - **Multimedia** dictates that words should be combined with pictures/graphics rather than words alone
- Place words besides relevant pictures/graphics
    - **Temporal Cintiguity**: Associated words and pictures/graphics should never be in different slides. They should be adjacent to each other
- Provide unique information in each channel
    - Avoid **Redundancy**: Voiceover presentation shouldn't include text, do not read your slides (provide differnt words than the ones on screen)
- Pre-training: Make sure everyone is familiar with the main concepts of what you will be presenting
- Use conversational rather than formal style (human voice > machine voicce)
- Don't worry about having an image of your face on screen in a remote/virtual presentation. It does not add to learning

### Other tips - Step-by-Step Guide

1. Define the big idea, refine it, enhance it. Don't be afraid to be bold.
    - Heighten the pain of inaction and the reward of action
1. Craft an abstract: Expand your idea into an abstract and use it as a guide to develop your content
    - It should include background, problem statement, value to the audience
1. Brainstorm ideas: This can be done by hand (e.g., Postits) or mapping software. Let your ideas flow **uninhibited** with an easy way to organize them later.
    - Some ueful prompts:
        - What storeis do you have on the topic?
        - What's new?
        - What other people can you bring int your presentation?
1. Organize ideas
    - Choose your ideas and group them into THREE key messages
    - Ensure strong opening
    - Build strong narrative
    - Ensure rewarding ending
1. Amplify ideas
    - Add compelling stories
    - Incorporate analogies, metaphors, and contrast
    - Insert poweful moments (memorable dramatrizations, repeatable soundbites, visuals, emotive storytelling, shocking stastistics)
    - Proactively handle objections
    - Ensure blanace of ethos, logos, and pathos
        - *Ethos*, your character and values; *Logos*, your logical arguments, *Pathos*, emotional connection to the audience
        - TED Talk style 65% pathos, 25% logos, 10% ethos
1. Design compelling slides
    - More than 75 words? It's starting to look like a document! (Nancy Duarte)
    - One idea per slide, a slide deck can be -hence- long sometimes.
        - Ensure the audience can get the gist of the slide within 3 seconds
        - Spend two minutes or less on each slide to ensure visual variety and engagement
        - Visuals >>> Text/Bullets
            - One good option is to use full-screen images/visuals when possible
            - Ensure visual consistency (colours, fonts, etc)
1. Practice your presentation
    - Aim to spend one hours for every minute of your presentation
        - 30 min presentations? Then aim to spend 30 hours on it (4 business days)
        - Practice the setting (in person? sitting? standing? virtual?)
        - Present to an audience or record and check yourself
            - Check your body language
1. Body Language and presence
    - Make a commanding first impression
    - Enage with the audience, avoid barriers and keep sufficient eye contact
    - Stay in one spot, don't shuffle around (this is a sing of being nervous and be interpreted as lack of competence)
    - Modulate your voice
    - Smile longer, enjoy your presentation
    - Speak at a 190 words per minute rate
1. Follow up with handouts and a survey

- Test your equipment/set up
- Create audience checkpointsm anticpate silence, add extra rehearsal time
