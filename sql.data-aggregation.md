# What does Data Aggregation provide?

Data aggregation allows to identify trends, make comparisons, and gain insights that are not possible to obtain when analyzing elements on their own by gathering multiple sources.

`JOIN`s are way to aggregate data in SQL. See more [[here | sql.concepts.joins]].
