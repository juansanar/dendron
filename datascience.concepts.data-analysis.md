# What is Data Analysis?

It's the process used to make sense of the data collected. The goal of data analysis is to identify trends and rleationships within data to accurately answer a question at hand.

## The 4 phases of analysis
- Organize data
    - Sorting: To arrange data into a meaningful order to make it easier to understand, analyze, and visualize.
        - Sort Sheet: Sorts data based on one attribute (column) and keeps the relationships of the rows.
        - Sort Range: Does not keep relationships of the rows.
        - `SORT()`: This function sorts a `RANGE`, based on a column (written as a number and **not a literal**), and `TRUE` or `FALSE` for ASC or DESC order, respectively.
            - Note: The `SORT()` function actually changes the existing dataset, unlike using the UI/Data Menu which just rearranges the data in the original dataset.
    - Filtering: Surfacing  data that meets a specific criteria, and hiding the rest. A benefit of filtering the data is that after you fix errors or identify outliers, you can remove the filter and return the data to its original organization.
