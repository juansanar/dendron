## What is a string?

A **string** is a set of characters that helps to declare the texts in programming languages.

## `CONCAT`

A function that adds strings together to create new text strings that can be used as unique keys. For example, the function `SELECT CONCAT (‘Google’, ‘.com’)`, will return `Google.com`. The function can take any `string` value and added to the resulting string. In this way, `SELECT CONCAT ('Data', ' ', 'analysis', ' ', 'is', ' ', 'awesome!');` will return `Data analysis is awesome!`
